This project is an academic implementation of an inverted index system — a data structure that maps keywords to the line numbers where they occur in a text — developed entirely in Java as part of the Data Structures course at the University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR).

The program reads .txt files containing the input text and the list of keywords, then processes the content and stores the information using manually implemented data structures (i.e., without using built-in Java collections), including:
	•	Hash Table for fast access,
	•	Binary Search Tree (BST) to maintain alphabetical order,
	•	Singly Linked Lists to store line occurrences of each word.

After processing, the application generates a .txt output file containing the inverted index for the specified keywords.

Technologies used:
✅ Java 17
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
✅ Custom Data Structures (ADTs)

Educational purpose:
Strengthen understanding of core data structures through a practical text information retrieval system, simulating real-world search engine mechanisms.
