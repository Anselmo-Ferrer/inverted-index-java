# 📚 Inverted Index in Java

This project is an academic implementation of an **inverted index system** — a data structure that maps **keywords to the line numbers** where they occur in a text — developed entirely in **Java** as part of the **Data Structures** course at the **University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR)**.

The program reads `.txt` files containing the input text and the list of keywords, then processes the content and stores the information using **manually implemented data structures** (i.e., without using built-in Java collections), including:

- 🔹 **Hash Table** for fast access  
- 🔹 **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to maintain alphabetical order  
- 🔹 **Singly Linked Lists** to store line occurrences of each word  

After processing, the application generates a `.txt` output file containing the **inverted index** for the specified keywords.
